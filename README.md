## Goals:
1. Learn how to create a backend application with Node and Express
1. Learn how to store data in MongoDB
1. Work as a team with a group of strangers
1. Create a backend social media clone in 7 days

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, EJS, CSS, Node, Express, MongoDB

We started with the MERN stack but decided to use EJS for server side rendering. This gave us a good perspective on what it is like to build an entire application on the server. Since this project is organized with MVC architecture, then it is always possible return to this application and switch out EJS with React.


## Optimizations
Here is a list of tasks that we did not have time to complete or would like to complete in the future:
1. Add comment sections on each post
1. Add a variety of authentication methods
   - Google
   - Facebook
   - Windows
   - etc.
1. Add user badge to the header which links the the authenticated user's profile
1. Allow user to update profile information
1. Refactor the CSS so common styles are shared from one file
1. Improve CSS

## Lessons Learned:
This entire project was a great lesson. We started as a group of strangers with different levels of development experience and a common goal.
We learned how to:
- Come together as a team
- Fix mistakes without being too critical of each other
- Use Git and Github to manage our project
- Manage data with MongoDB and the Object Document Mapper, mongoose
- Create and run a server with Node and route requests with Express
- Create and render views from the server with EJS
- Organize our project with Model View Controller architecture
- Manage user information and passwords without worrying about leaking them in plain text
- Store and retrieve images in the cloud
